# Crystallite

Crystallite is a theme for VIM text editor that tries to look dark & colorful.
It started off with a VIM theme picker, but I eventually ended up tweaking
many things just by hand.

Fully supported languages:
+ Python
+ Pascal
+ Java
+ C, C++
+ CMake
+ Bash
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ PHP
+ MySQL (probably also SQL)

# Installing

You can either use a plugin manager or install crystallite manually.
Either way, you have to tell vim to use the colorscheme.

## Plugin manager

+ Dein: `call dein#add('tomsik68/vim-crystallite')`
+ Plug: `Plug 'tomsik68/vim-crystallite'`
+ ...

## Manual Installation

It's sufficient to download [colors/Crystallite.vim](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomsik68/vim-crystallite/master/colors/Crystallite.vim) and place it into your `.vim/colors` folder. This is exactly what `install.sh` script does. If you decide to use it, it will also update your `vimrc`.

## Applying the colorscheme

Add `colorscheme Crystallite` to your `vimrc`.
